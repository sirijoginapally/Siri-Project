# Data Analyst Project

Welcome to My Data Analysis Portfolio! ðŸš€ As an aspiring data analyst with a passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights, Iâ€™ve embarked on a journey through Data Analysis. Here, Iâ€™ve honed my skills in Python and its powerful data analysis librariesâ€”NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and moreâ€”while mastering the art of data cleaning, visualization, and insightful storytelling. Dive into my projects, where I uncover patterns, draw meaningful conclusions, and showcase the critical findings that drive decision-making. Join me as I explore the world of data and continuously evolve in this exciting field!

## Project 1: Traffic prediction for ITS using Machine Learning

* In a world where every minute counts, sitting in traffic is a problem that begs for a smart solution. This project harnesses the power of deep learning to transform the unpredictable chaos of traffic into actionable predictions by implementing and comparing three advanced neural network architecturesâ€”RNN, LSTM, and GRUâ€”to forecast traffic patterns 24 hours in advance with remarkable accuracy. 
* Analyzing three years of historical traffic data across multiple locations, our model learns from patterns in vehicle density, time variations, and seasonal changes, with LSTM emerging as the champion algorithm due to its adeptness at capturing the complex, non-linear nature of traffic flow. 
* Moreover, we've created a user-friendly web interface with Django, making these predictions accessible to daily commuters, delivery services, and city planners alike, providing valuable insights for informed decision-making. 
* Key highlights include 24-hour traffic forecasting with hour-by-hour granularity, a comparative analysis of the neural network architectures, validated accuracy using RMSE metrics, and comprehensive training on a rich historical dataset.

## Project 2: Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning
* Stock market prediction is one of the most challenging areas in financial forecasting due to its dynamic and chaotic nature. With the rise of global digitization and advanced machine learning techniques, we've entered a new era of data-driven trading that has the potential to revolutionize investment decision-making.
* This project aims to develop a more objective, data-driven approach by comparing various machine learning algorithms to identify the most effective method for predicting stock prices, using Appleâ€™s stock data from 2015 to 2020 as our test case. We evaluated multiple models, including Moving Average, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM).
* Key features of the project include a comparative analysis of these algorithms, a focus on emotion-free predictions, extensive visualization of model performance, and practical implementation. Our findings indicate that LSTM networks significantly outperform traditional machine learning approaches in terms of stock price prediction accuracy, showcasing their ability to capture long-term patterns in time-series data.

## Project 3: Why delays Increased so Much at EWR in 2022
* In 2022, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) faced a puzzling 50% surge in flight delays, despite handling fewer flights than pre-pandemic levels.
* This comprehensive data analysis revealed a surprising twist: contrary to common assumptions, weather wasn't the primary culprit. Instead, the research uncovered a significant post-COVID reduction in the airport's operational capacity, with taxi-in delays soaring from 18% in 2018 to 30.4% in 2022.
* The study, which combined operational metrics analysis with social media sentiment (analyzing 2,100+ tweets, revealing 59.7% negative sentiment), pointed to reduced efficiency metrics across the board - from Airport Departure Rates (ADR) to System Airport Efficiency Rate (SAER).
*  Using advanced techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling and sentiment analysis, the research identified that EWR consistently operated below its maximum capacity, suggesting that the airport's infrastructure and operational efficiency need significant improvements to handle the returning passenger volumes effectively.
*  This analysis not only explains the current delay crisis but also raises important questions about post-pandemic airport operations and capacity management.
